<h1>LEARNING THE BASICS OF HTML AND CSS</h1>
<h2>Chapter 1: HTML</h2>
<div class="intro">
<p>I like to play video games in my free time. It's been an expensive hobby of mine for several decades. <span>I've even turned it into
a side job where I livestream different video games for people online and occasionally make money off of it.</span></p>
</div>
<p>I am the oldest of 3 children along with being the only male child from my parents. My youngest sister is currently working on getting a bioscience degree from a university in London,
    while my other sister is a proud mother of two toddler boys. I enjoy being an uncle but there are times when I wish they were older so there would be fewer tantrums.</p>
<p>In recent years, I have joined a small group of people who are slowly growing by the day that understand me on a level that makes me happy because they have experienced
the same issues and struggles that I have or more. This group of people are called neurodivergent and come with a wide range of mental diagnoses such as bipolar, ADHD, Autism and much more.
Through this group, I have made many friends who have taught me more than I knew about my own diagnosis of ADHD for over 2 decades along granting me more knowledge on mental diagnoses in general.</p>
